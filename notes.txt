Todo:
* Clean repository. This contains at this point full server deployment with fail2ban included.
* Write documentatation about what the hell this repository is all about
* Server-settings away from vars/main.yml
* Updated to latest factorio server release
* Make deployment a bit simpler (docker based maybe). This should make redeployment much simpler.
